# Sharibo Client SDK

This package provides a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Sharibo contract on Stellar/Soroban.

## Retry Semantics

Network requests in the Soroban testnet environment can occasionally fail due to rate limits or transient load (e.g. `429 Too Many Requests`, `503 Service Unavailable`, or timeouts).

The SDK automatically handles these transient failures:
- **Simulation Phase:** Contract calls (e.g. `createCircle`, `fund`, `claim`, `getCircle`) will retry simulation/preparation steps automatically using exponential backoff with jitter (up to 3 retries, starting at 500ms).
- **Submit Phase:** Once a transaction is signed and submitted to the network (`signAndSend`), no further automatic retries are attempted. This ensures safety against double-spend or replay issues. A failure during submission or polling will surface immediately to the caller, as the state of the transaction is ambiguous.
